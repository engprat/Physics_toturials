**Physics Tutorials**
Physics Tutorials is a Unity-based educational simulation designed to explore and demonstrate fundamental physics principles through interactive gameplay. The project provides an engaging platform for experimenting with concepts such as gravity, mass, torque, and resistance, offering practical insights into how these forces influence object behavior.


Features:
  - Gravity Simulation: The project demonstrates realistic gravitational forces by allowing a ball to fall within a virtual environment. Players can observe how gravity affects the ball’s acceleration and interactions with other objects.
  
  - Mass Dynamics: The simulation allows users to see how different mass values impact the ball’s movement and reaction to forces. This feature helps in understanding inertia and the relationship between mass and acceleration.
  
  - Torque Application: Players can apply torque to the platform to influence the ball’s trajectory and rotational motion. This provides a practical way to study rotational forces and their effects on object movement.
  
  - Resistance Effects: The project includes resistance elements such as friction, simulating how opposing forces affect the ball’s speed and direction. This helps in visualizing drag and other resistance-related phenomena.
  
  - Interactive Gameplay: The core gameplay involves controlling a platform to guide the falling ball. This interaction provides a hands-on approach to learning about physics principles by directly manipulating variables and observing their outcomes.


Usage: Physics Tutorials is designed for educational purposes, offering a dynamic environment for exploring and understanding basic physics concepts. It is suitable for students, educators, and developers interested in visualizing and experimenting with gravitational forces, mass, torque, and resistance in an interactive setting.

Future Development: The project is intended as a foundation for further development, with potential updates including additional physics scenarios, enhanced visual effects, and expanded interactive elements based on user feedback and educational needs.
