          Your player character in this scene, the
          Boximon Cyclops or box monster, needs to move when keyboard buttons are
          pressed. You''ll use a Player Controller script for this functionality.'

      Text:
        m_Untranslated: '1. Select the Boximon Cyclops prefab GameObject in the Hierarchy
          window.


          2. In the Inspector window, locate the two scripts
          you added earlier.


          3. In the Player Controls script, add Boximon
          Cyclops Character Controller and Animator to Controller and Anim properties.


          Use
          the circle with a dot inside icon to select the Boximon Cyclops items.


          NOTE:
          The script uses the Character Controller and Animator (a file that controls
          when prefab animations are used) in order to control the character while
          in gameplay.


          4. Select an audio clip for the Running Sound
          if you want one.


          5. Choose to use either the Player 1 controls,
          Player 2 controls, or both to move your character by selecting at least
          one of the options.


          6. Free Rotation, when checked, will allow
          the player to rotate the character freely. When unchecked, the character
          will rotate in 90-degree increments. Leave this checked for now.


          7.
          Feel free to adjust and test the remaining properties to see how they affect
          box monster''s movement in Game mode.  You can adjust these later as well
          while testing the final scene.


          Select the Next button to adjust
          the Collision Controller script.'
